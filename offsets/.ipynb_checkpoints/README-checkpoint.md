## Jupyter Notebooks for estimating horn telescope poitning offsets.
### Glen Langston - National Scienc foundation - 2022 February 4

Here we provide a sequence of Aficionado/Student/Teacher/Hobbist projects.
These plotting and computing tools guide you in looking at your own ombservations.
<p>
The notebooks in this group are used to estimate pointing offsets from 24 hour "drife scan" observations of the sky.   We assume you've built a telescope and left it outside for one or more days.  By recording a whole day's observations you observations cross the Milky Way's _Galactic Plane_ twice.   By measuring
the time differences between the crossings, you can estimate the pointing offset of your horn.
<p>
Everyone's telescope will have some small pointing offset.  To make the best maps of the sky, we want to correct these pointing offsets.
