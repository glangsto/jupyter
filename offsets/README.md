## Jupyter Notebooks for estimating Horn Telescope Pointing Offsets.
### Glen Langston - National Scienc foundation - 2022 February 5

Here we provide a sequence of Aficionado/Student/Teacher/Hobbist projects.
These plotting and computing tools guide you in looking at your own ombservations.
<p>
The notebooks in this group are used to estimate pointing offsets from 24 hour "drife scan" observations of the sky.   We assume you've built a telescope and left it outside for one or more days.  By recording a whole day's observations you observations cross the Milky Way's _Galactic Plane_ twice.   By measuring
the time differences between the crossings, you can estimate the pointing offset of your horn.
<p>
Everyone's telescope will have some small pointing offset.  To make the best maps of the sky, we want to correct these pointing offsets.

<h3> A notebook for each topic</h3>
<ol>
<li>
First calculate the location of the galactic plane in the sky.

  This notebook plots a model of the Milky Way Galactic Plane crossing coordinates.

  <p>
  This notebook computes the Sky Coordinates of the Azimuth and Elevation of the pointing
  direction of your telescope.  A pointing error is assumed to show the effect this
  has on the direction of your observations.   You can estimate your own pointing offsets.
  The goal of this notebook is to show how important your location, time and pointing accuracy are
  in successful observations.
